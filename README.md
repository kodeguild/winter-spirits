### Contributing

Currently there are English and Russian versions.
If you'd like to provide translation and content in another language, read on.

__Please, open an issue "*SomeLanguage* localization" before you start, so that others know you're working on it, and for further collaboration.__

__Three steps__ for creating a full localization:
__1__. Translate general [website strings](/src/data/locales).
__2__. Add *42 (+1) [fortune cookies](/src/data/cookies) in the chosen language. These may be some inspirational phrases, uplifting quotes or wise proverbs â€” anything you'd expect to find in a fortune cookie. A cookie shouldn't be longer than 105 characters. The first (0) cookie should be test cookie, it won't be displayed to the user, but you can still write something nice there.
__3__. Add 12 [extracts](/src/data/quotes) from literature about Christmas, New Year, winter in the chosen language. Any genre (except may be poetry?), any author. Something kind, humorous, text that warms heart and makes you smile. __This is probably the most time-consuming part__, finding good winterish extracts isn't easy.

After that, the only thing left is to add your lang to [main.js](/src/main.js) file.

Once the localization is ready, hopefully some other users (native-speakers of the chosen language) will have a look, to be sure that the provided content fits the mood of the project.

Thanks in advance!

**Number [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_%28number%29) is "the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything" in a [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(novel)) by Douglas Adams. If in your culture it's an unlucky number, don't panic. You'll actually add 43 fortune cookies, because arrays start with zeroes, and our cookie counter starts with 1 :)*
