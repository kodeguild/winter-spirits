    author: 'Joyce Rupp',
    body: `One winter morning I awoke to see magnificent lines of frost stretching across my window panes. They seemed to rise with the sunshine and the bitter cold outside. They looked like little miracles that had been formed in the dark of the night. I watched them in sheer amazement and marveled that such beautiful forms could be born during such a winter-cold night. \n\n Yet, as I pondered them I thought of how life is so like that. We live our long, worn days in the shadows, in what often feels like barren, cold winter, so unaware of the miracles that are being created in our spirits. It takes the sudden daylight, some unexpected surprise of life, to cause our gaze to look upon a simple, stunning growth that has happened quietly inside us. Like frost designs on a winter window, they bring us beyond life’s fragmentation and remind us that we are not nearly as lost as we thought we were, that all the time we thought we were dead inside, beautiful things were being born in us.`

    author: 'Mark Helprin, Winter’s Tale',
    body: 'Winter, then in its early and clear stages, was a purifying engine that ran unhindered over city and country, alerting the stars to sparkle violently and shower their silver light into the arms of bare upreaching trees. It was a mad and beautiful thing that scoured raw the souls of animals and man, driving them before it until they loved to run. And what it did to Northern forests can hardly be described, considering that it iced the branches of the sycamores on Chrystie Street and swept them back and forth until they rang like ranks of bells.'

    author: 'Thomas de Quincey, Confessions of an English Opium-Eater',
    body: 'Let there be a cottage. A real cottage. A white cottage, embowered with flowering shrubs, so chosen as to unfold a succession of flowers upon the walls, and clustering round the windows through all the months of spring, summer, and autumn — beginning, in fact, with May roses, and ending with jasmine. Let it, however, not be spring, nor summer, nor autumn — but winter, in his sternest shape. This is a most important point in the science of happiness. And I am surprised to see people overlook it, and think it matter of congratulation that winter is going; or, if coming, is not likely to be a severe one. On the contrary, I put up a petition annually, for as much snow, hail, frost, or storm, of one kind or other, as the skies can possibly afford us. Surely everybody is aware of the divine pleasures which attend a winter fire-side: candles at four o’clock, warm hearth-rugs, tea, a fair tea-maker, shutters closed, curtains flowing in ample draperies on the floor, whilst the wind and rain are raging audibly without.'

    author: 'Lucy Maud Montgomery, Anne of Green Gables',
    body: 'The night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy slope; big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the wind whistling through them.'

    author: 'Edward Payson Powell, The New Year In',
    body: 'It is 9 o’clock, and I am sitting before the big fireplace in my library, where the pine knots are fast becoming ashes. Why not? Yes, why not see the Old Year out and the New Year in? I will pile more knots on the embers, and, leaning back in my chair, will see how the two years are mortised together. Why should I not help to look after these things, for I have had nearly eighty of these years, and every one of them chock full of gifts and goodness? I will have nothing to do with the doleful dolts, who count their troubles and see only what is missing. Have you any idea how many years are locked together in one of these pine knots? Different trees, like different folk, vary in power to carry bruises and scratches. Early in life I learned there were two sides to everything, and I resolved that I would see always the bright side. The more I see of the world, the more I am sure there is sunshine enough to go around. After all and through it all, to make life worth the while, what we must have and make for health and growth, is soul-shine.'

    author: 'John Burroughs, Winter Sunshine',
    body: 'The sunbeams are welcome now. They seem like pure electricity — like friendly and recuperating lightning. Are we led to think electricity abounds only in summer, when we see in the storm-clouds as it were, the veins and ore-beds of it? I imagine it is equally abundant in winter, and more equable and better tempered. Who ever breasted a snowstorm without being excited and exhilarated, as if this meteor had come charged with latent aurora of the North, as doubtless it has? It is like being pelted with sparks from a battery.'

    author: 'Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Wind, Sand and Stars',
    body: 'Sitting in the flickering light of the candles on this kerchief of sand, on this village square, we waited in the night. We were waiting for the rescuing dawn - or for the Moors. Something, I know not what, lent this night a savor of Christmas. We told stories, we joked, we sang songs. In the air there was that slight fever that reigns over a gaily prepared feast. And yet we were infinitely poor. Wind, sand, and stars. The austerity of Trappists. But on this badly lighted cloth, a handful of men who possessed nothing in the world but their memories were sharing invisible riches.'

    author: 'T.H. White, The Once and Future King',
    body: 'It was Christmas night, the eve of the Boxing Day Meet. You must remember that this was in the old Merry England of Gramarye, when the rosy barons ate with their fingers, and had peacocks served before them with all their tail feathers streaming, or boars’ heads with the tusks stuck in again — when there was no unemployment because there were too few people to be unemployed — when the forests rang with knights walloping each other on the helm, and the unicorns in the wintry moonlight stamped with their silver feet and snorted their noble breaths of blue upon the frozen air. Such marvels were great and comfortable ones. But in the Old England there was a greater marvel still. The weather behaved itself.'

    author: 'Bess Streeter Aldrich, Song of Years',
    body: 'If you listened above the din of the talking you could hear the wind in the chimney turn into music. Christmas Eve was a night of song that wrapped itself about you like a shawl. But it warmed more than your body. It warmed your heart… filled it, too, with melody that would last forever. Even though you grew up and found you could never quite bring back the magic feeling of this night, the melody would stay in your heart always — a song for all the years.'

    author: 'Ellen Goodman, The Boston Globe',
    body: 'Soon we will have completed our annual list of good intentions. Once again, we will pass resolutions as if we were our own Congress, legislating changes in our lives. On a million scraps of paper, we will publish an updated catalog of promises to be filed on the shelf of the self... But I have a feeling that our resolutions have more to do with controlling our lives than enriching them.\n\nWe spend Jan. 1 walking through our lives, room by room, drawing up a punch list of work to be done, cracks to be patched. We decide that it’s time to get a painful grip on ourselves. But life improvement is not just a matter of discipline, self-control. It’s a matter of expansion, the deliberate pursuit of happiness.\n\nWe ought to walk through the rooms of our lives a second time, not looking for the flaws, but for potential.'

    body: 'My dear,\n\nIn the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.\n\nAnd that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back.'

    author: 'John Burroughs, Winter Sunshine',
    body: 'Like a forest, rose the huge peaks above the slumbering village, measuring the night and heavens. They beckoned him.\n\nAnd something born of the snowy desolation, born of the midnight and the  silent grandeur, born of the great listening hollows of the night,  something that lay ’twixt terror and wonder, dropped  from the vast wintry spaces down into his heart — and called him. Very softly, unrecorded in any word or thought his brain could compass, it laid its spell upon him. Fingers of snow brushed the surface of his heart.'
